## FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

### How do I import the dotfiles?

Use this command:

```bash
git clone --separate-git-dir=~/.dotfiles https://github.com/datwaft/dotfiles.git ~
```

> This will clone the contents of the remote repository (the .git link) to the home directory (~) while referencing ~/.dotfiles as the local bare repository (the â€”seperate-git-dir part).

**Warning:** Your home directory shouldn't containt any of the dotfiles present inside the directory.
